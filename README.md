# eCommerce_DataScience_Project
Data Science project focusing on exploratory data analysis, lookalike modeling, and customer segmentation using an eCommerce transaction dataset.

This repository contains the deliverables for a comprehensive Data Science assignment centered on analyzing eCommerce transaction data. The project demonstrates proficiency in exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

## Project Overview

The dataset consists of three main files:
1. **`Customers.csv`**: Customer demographic and profile data.
2. **`Products.csv`**: Details of products, including categories and prices.
3. **`Transactions.csv`**: Transaction data, including quantities, values, and dates.

The project is divided into three main tasks:
- **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analysis and insight generation based on the dataset.
- **Task 2: Lookalike Model**: A recommendation system to identify similar customers.
- **Task 3: Customer Segmentation**: Clustering customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing strategies.

  - Key findings include insights on demographics, spending patterns, and product preferences.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- **Objective**: Build a model to recommend similar customers.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - `Luv_Pahwa_Lookalike.ipynb`: Notebook containing the recommendation system code.
  - `Lookalike.csv`: File listing the top 3 similar customers for the first 20 customers, with similarity scores.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation
- **Objective**: Group customers into clusters using profile and transaction data.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - `Luv_Pahwa_Clustering.ipynb`: Notebook with clustering logic and analysis.
  - `Luv_Pahwa_Clustering_Report.pdf`: Report summarizing:
    - Number of clusters formed: **10**.
    - DB Index: **0.91**.
    - Insights into cluster behavior and patterns.
